            <p>Week 5 was our first week in person in class, and while I find the environment supportive and surprisingly conducive to work this week really hammered home my need to increase my efficiency in arriving at the correct questions to begin asking to understand a challenge.  I spent three days this week coding for 14 or more hours, which is obviously unsustainable--though at this juncture while it was stressful it was enjoyable at times to immerse myself so fully in making something.  We worked extensively with bootstrap this week while creating a fake campaign website, and I both loathe and love it.  The use of a library is both boon and bane--much of the CSS is done for me, but the strictures of that CSS are not fully transparent.  As a result I struggled with getting the appearance and effects I desired without the "brute force" of augmenting CSS.</p>
            
            <p>Our second project was a "mindreader" game showcasing  a simple mathematical formula that always produces the same result.  I struggled with this one as well, but the problem turned out not to be anything I was coding incorrectly, but not understanding the logic by which elements are created in js.  I was trying to serve the entire webpage and thus all the styling out of the js file, and while I succeeded to a certain degree the appearance of the project left something to be desired.  I learned a great deal that I intend to take advantage of moving forward as I refactor my blog, in particular about serving a site dynamically.</p>
