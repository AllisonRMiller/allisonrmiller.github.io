        <p>Week 4 was the last week of our pre-work and consequently the last week of work for me.  Balancing completion of assignments off of workload has been a challenge, particularly since, as mentioned previously, my last weeks of work involved a significant amount of overtime.  I began these classes in large part because my unit at the workplace I'm leaving lost their contract and will be dissolved by the end of June. However, the drawdown of work has not progressed as expected, and more members of the unit left early than originally expected, resulting in the overtime.  I'm relieved to no longer be splitting my energy between both environments.</p>

        <p>I didn't make many changes to this blog this week as we'll be refactoring with boostrap soon.  We had two js assignments this week involving time functions and incorporating time into js apps: a clock and a timer.  While it took me a while to figure out the clock in a satisfactory way, once I had it I was able to reuse some of the code for my timer as a few of the functions were shared across both.</p>
