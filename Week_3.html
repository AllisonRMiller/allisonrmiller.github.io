            <p>Week 3 of our prework is the last week during which I was responsible for overtime at work, and hopefully the end of lagging slightly behind because of it.  We dove into javascript this week, which I confess to struggling slightly with.  While the syntax is incredibly important, I almost get the feeling that so long as you're typing words and those words are defined something will happen.  It might not be what was intended, but it's something alright! I'm doing much better with guided javascript exercises than more freeform ones, which I think is just a matter of really internalizing the logic of the language.</p>

            <p>I wasted quite a bit of time on attempting to create a modal element to contain these blog posts in such that they'll all appear on the same page.  While the modal element itself works perfectly, I somehow managed to break closing it, and much of the documentation I'm able to find referring to modals discusses them specifically in the context of bootstrap.  As such I've temporarily abandoned that and will continue looking for an elegant solution to my problem.</p>
