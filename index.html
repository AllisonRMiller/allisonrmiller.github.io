            <p>In week one we covered the basics of github, which I had not handled from the back end previously.  I find that I am struggling a little bit with interfacing with it from the command line even though I can stumble through, but I think that will come with practice and the handy reference sheet we've been linked to. Otherwise my greatest struggles have been adjusting to using a mac, and time management since I've been in overtime at work while beginning this course.  I already have a basic familiarity with HTML and some experience altering CSS and am very much looking forward to learning more about them.</p>
